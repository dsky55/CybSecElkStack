# CybSecElkStack
Cyber Security Elk Stack Project
README.md

I would have liked to tar-and-gzip the /etc/ansible folder having the the week 12 ansible YML
files, hosts, .cfg, and the files folder having filebeat YML files, but I didn't know how to
copy the file from the docker/ansible container to the jumpbox then to my PC.  

I took screensnap shots instead.  

Here is a guide to the files in CybSecElkStack:

Ansible contains screensnapshots of the linux commands or displaying the text 
of configurations.  I did copy the text of hosts and elf.cfg.
Most files are self describing.

Diagrams contains the data-flow/system or physical architecture diagram and screen snapshots of the Azure 
VMs or Network Security Group home pages.
Week 13 CyberSecurityBootCamp HOmeWork Diagram.png has the architecture diagram.
Other screensnap shots are self describing.

Linux contains screen snapshots of the opening pages of the DVWA application on the load balanced web servers.
kibana-home-page.png has the opening page of the kibana app on the Elk server.
